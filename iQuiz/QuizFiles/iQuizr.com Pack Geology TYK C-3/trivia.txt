MC
A surface seperating different rock types is called a
xenolith
contact
chill zone
none of the proceding

MC
The major difference between intrusive igneous rocks and extrusive igneous rocks is
where they solidify
chemical composition
type of minerals
all of the preceding
1


MC
Which is not an instrusive igneous rock?
gabbro
diorite
granite
andesite
4


MC
By definition, stocks differ from batholiths in
size
shape
chemical composition
all of the preceding
1


MC
Which is not a source of heat for melting rock?
geothermal gradient
the hotter mantle
mantle plumes
water under pressure
4


MC
The geothermal gradient is, on the average, about
1 degree C/km
10 degrees C/km
30 degrees C/km
50 degrees C/km

MC
The most common igneous rock of the continents is
basalt
granite
rhyolite
ultramafic
2


MC
Granitic magmas are associated with
convergent boundaries and magmatic underplating
divergent boundaries nad differentiation
convergent boundaries and decompression melting
divergent boundaries and water release
1


MC
The difference in texture between intrusive and extrusive rock is primarily due to
different mineralogy
different rates of cooling and crystalization
different amounts of water in the magma

2


MC
Mafic magma is generated at divergent boudaries because of
water under pressure
decompression melting
magmatic underplating
melting of the lithosphere
2


MC
A change in magma composition due to melting of surrounding country rock is called
magma mixing
assimilation
crystal setting
partial melting
