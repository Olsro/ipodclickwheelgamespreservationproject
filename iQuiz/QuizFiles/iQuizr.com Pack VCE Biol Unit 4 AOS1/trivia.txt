the cross demonstrates that bent tails is the recessive phenotype.

The gene responsible for the autosomal recessive condition PKU controls the production of an enzyme that converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine.  The gene has the alleles: P - produced enzyme, p - no enzyme produced.  In a person lacking the en

each person in a population would have one of three possible genotypes at the PKU gene locus.
a PKU individual treated from soon after birth would not be able to pass allele p onto their offspring.
because the disease can be treated, one would expect the number of babies born with PKU to decline over time.
