greenschist
phyllite
slate
gneiss
4


MC
Shearing is a type of
compressive stress
confining pressure
lithostatic pressure
differential stress
4


MC
Metamorphic rocks with planar texture (the constituents of the rock are parallel to one another) are said to be
concordant
foliated
discordant
nonfoliated
2


MC
Metamorphic rocks are classified primarily on
texture- the presence or absence of foliation
mineralogy- the presence or absence of quartz
environment of deposition
chemical composition
1


MC

hornfels
marble
quartzite
schist
1


MC
Quartz sandstone is changed during metamorphism into
hornfels
marble
quartzite
schist

MC
The correct sequence of rocks that are formed when shale undergoes prograde metamorphism is
slate,gneiss,schist,phyllite
phyllite,slate,schist,gneiss
slate,phyllite,schist,gneiss
schist,phyllite,slate,gneiss

MC
The major difference between metamorphism and metasomatism is
temperature at which each takes place
the minerals involved
the area or region involved
metasomatism is metamophism coupled with the introductions of ions from an external source
4


MC
Ore bodies at divergent plate boundaries can be created through
contact metamorphism
regional metamorphism
hydrothermal processes

3


MC
Metamorphic rocks with the same mineral assemblage belong to the same
metamorphic facies
prograde metamorphism
schistosity
isograd
1


MC
A metamorphic rock that has undergone partial melting to produce a mixed igneous-metamorphic rock is a
gneiss
hornfels
schist
migmatite
