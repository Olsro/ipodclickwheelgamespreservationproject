gravel
sand
silt
clay

MC
Rounding is
The rounding of a grain to a spherical shape
the grinding away of sharp edges and corners of rock fragments during transportation
a type of mineral
none of the proceding
2


MC
Compaction and cementation are two common processes of
erosion
transportation
deposition
lithification
4


MC
Which is not a chemical or organic sedimentary rock?
rock salt
shale
limestone
gypsum
2


MC
The major difference between breccia and conglomerate is
size of grains
rounding of the grains
composition of grains
all of the preceding

MC
Which is not a type of sandstone?
quartz sandstone
arkose
graywacke
coal
4


MC
shale differs from mudstone in that
shale has larger grain
shale is visibly layered and fissile; mudstone is massive and blocky
shale has smaller grains
there is no difference between shale and mudstone

a flood
a regression
a transgression
no geologic change will take place
