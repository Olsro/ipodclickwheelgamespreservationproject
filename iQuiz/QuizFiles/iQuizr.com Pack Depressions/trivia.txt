MC
The upper air jet stream has
No effect on the formation of a depression
Variable speeds
An effect by 'pulling' the depression along from the west to the east
No effect on the movement of a depression
3


MC
The rotation of the earth produces the
Seasons
Coriolis Force
Air pressure to drop
Air pressure to rise
2


MC
When the 2 air masses converge they
Move in different directions
Subside to ground level
Spiral upwards in the 'vacuum cleaner' effect
Form an anticyclone
3


MC
The trigger for a depression is
A bad day
Development of upper air movement  ahead of a trough
Low pressure
Cyclogenesis

The North Sea
The Thames
The North Atlantic
London

MC
Which is the correct sequence?
ACRCRC
ARCCCR
RACCCR
CACARRC

MC
Widely spaced isobars indicate
Steep pressure gradient
Gentle pressure gradient
Strong winds
Heavy rain
2


MC
Air pressure is measured in
Millibars
At the bar
Isobars
Millimetres

MC
Air which is warm
Expands and rises
Cools and subsides
Floats about a bit
Is nice
1


MC
Pressure continues to fall and
Wind speeds increase
Cold front rapidly undercuts the warm air which rises even faster
Warm sector progressively shrinks in size
All of the above

MC
When the cold front catches up with the warm front it is called
An occlusion
A shame
An anticyclone
A cold front
